compile code: javac AIPlayer.java GameLogic.java Human.java HumanPlayer.java MyGame.java Main.java Player.java Status.java SwingGUI.java UI.java
run code: java Main

when i am using textUi the gameOver method works good 
but when using SwingGUI it just runs contuneous even if the player won the game
